{"archive":{"icon":{"def":"zip.png"},"info":"Compressed archives combine multiple files into a single file to make them easier to transport or save on diskspace.  Archiving software may also provide options for encryption, file spanning, checksums, self-extraction, and self-installation. Zip is the most-widely used format, used by the Windows operating system and more recently by OSX as well. RAR is also a very popular and flexible format. Unix uses the tar file format, while Linux uses the tar and gz format.","apps":[{"icon":"http:\/\/img.informer.com\/icons\/png\/48\/1399\/1399338.png","name":"WinZip for PC","link":"http:\/\/www.winzip.com\/win\/en\/index.html"},{"icon":"http:\/\/img.informer.com\/icons\/png\/48\/1399\/1399338.png","name":"WinZip for Mac","link":"http:\/\/www.winzip.com\/mac\/en\/index.html"}]},"document":{"icon":{"def":"doc.png","pdf":"pdf.png"},"extn":[],"info":"Microsoft published the specs for XML file formats in 2003 and licensed them to competitors. Over the years there has been a push toward an open standards environment, and currently Open XML and Open Document Format (ODF) are at the forefront. The XML format is very much in favor because data in a file can be reused. This reuse was not possible with binary file formats. The XML format is expected to be the future of document file formats.","apps":[{"icon":"http:\/\/c.fsdn.com\/allura\/mirror\/openofficeorg\/icon","name":"Apache OpenOffice","link":"http:\/\/www.openoffice.org\/download"}]},"audio":{"icon":{"def":"video.png"},"extn":[],"info":"Audio can be stored uncompressed, as with .aiff and .wav files. Lossless compression schemes, as used in .flac files, preserve the original sound quality by only removing unnecessary and redundant data. MP3, by far the most popular audio format, removes data using a lossy scheme which results in a slight loss of audio quality but significant compression. The AAC format is capable of better audio quality than MP3 in the general bit rate range, at the cost of less compression ability.","apps":[{"icon":"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-cfDwIhg9-00\/Tftclccl_uI\/AAAAAAAAATo\/FNlie4xAIiA\/s1600\/w+m+p+11.png","name":"Window Media Player 11","link":"http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-US\/windows\/products\/windows-media-player"},{"icon":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/0\/0c\/ITunes_11_Logo.png","name":"iTunes","link":"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/itunes"}]},"video":{"icon":{"def":"video.png"},"extn":[],"info":"As with all media formats, video formats run the spectrum between high quality and low file size.
